What do you think is a particularly good use case for LLMs for science? How would you evaluate it? Your answer does not need to be in paragraphs. When you submit your homework form, you can link to a file in your Github repo where you wrote your answer.

A particularly good use case for LLMs in science is for materials discovery considering the resources (time and money) that is sunk into theorizing, making, and confirming the existence of materials for specific applications. Of course there have been many cases where the theorized materials that LLMs generate are in actuality physically impossible to exist, and determining those bad cases does have to be done by an expert in the end. But that is the case for any type of computation or theory anyways - they must be able to hold water when subject to scrutiny. Thus, the biggest plus to using the LLM is just for the generation of potential ideas that perhaps we are too narrow minded to see.
